Task Manager - Hackbright porject
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Registered application with Google Developers Console and received my OAuth 2.0 
credentials.

Virtual environment created for this project with the following installed:
    Google api libraries for python using pip 

Implementing Gmail RESTful API:
    Used Google Sign-in to provide the user secure login and to avoid the user from
    having to remember an additional username and passwords. User signs in and chooses 
    their account, they would have to allow authorization for the task manager in order 
    to access their inbox.


Created model.py, server.py, seed.py, tests.py as well as the skeleton templates to 
assist in testing the Gmail scopes.
